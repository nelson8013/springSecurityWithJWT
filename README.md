# springSecurityWithJWT
Implementation of Spring Security with JWT in Springboot 2.5.0.

So this is my implementation of Spring Security in a lower spring boot version. In this version, I have experimented with permissions for certain URLs, token issuance from the server to the client 
and token verification using JWT.
